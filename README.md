### Setting Up Local Environment Variables

To ensure Agentic Voice functions correctly, you need to set up local environment variables. This involves creating a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and adding the necessary API keys. Follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the `agentic-voice` project.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/agentic-voice
   ```

2. **Create the `.env.local` File:**

   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root directory of your project.

   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

3. **Add Environment Variables:**

   Open the `.env.local` file in a text editor and add your API keys. The required keys are for Deepgram, OpenAI, and Exa API. Here is an example of what the file should look like:

   ```plaintext
   DEEPGRAM_STT_DOMAIN=https://api.deepgram.com
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   EXASEARCH_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_deepgram_api_key_here`, `your_openai_api_key_here`, and `your_exa_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

4. **Save and Close:**

   Save the `.env.local` file and close the text editor.

5. **Verify Setup:**

   Ensure the environment variables are loaded correctly by restarting your development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Additional Configuration

If you need to add more environment variables or change existing ones, simply edit the `.env.local` file. The application will automatically load these variables when it starts.

By correctly setting up your environment variables, you ensure that Agentic Voice can securely and efficiently interact with the required APIs, providing a seamless user experience.


## Customizing Keywords

To customize the keywords used by Agentic Voice, modify the `keywords.js` file located at `/agentic-voice/app/api/utils/keywords.js`. You can add, remove, or change the keywords and their associated phrases.

```javascript
const keywords = {
  // Add broad trigger keywords or phrases here
  "weather": ["weather", "temperature", "forecast", "climate"],
  "news": ["news", "headlines", "current events", "breaking news"],
  "sports": ["sports", "game", "score", "team"],
  "finance": ["stock", "market", "investment", "finance", "economy"],
  "technology": ["technology", "tech", "gadget", "innovation"],
  "entertainment": ["movie", "music", "entertainment", "show", "concert"],
  "health": ["health", "wellness", "medicine", "fitness"],
  "travel": ["travel", "vacation", "trip", "destination"],
  "food": ["food", "recipe", "cuisine", "restaurant"],
  "education": ["education", "learning", "school", "course"],
  "ai": ["ai", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "deep learning"],
  "developer": ["developer", "programming", "coding", "software", "github", "npm", "python", "javascript"],
};

/**
 * Extract keywords from user messages.
 * @param {Array} messages - Array of user messages.
 * @returns {Array} - Array of extracted keywords.
 */
function extractKeywords(messages) {
  const extractedKeywords = [];
  const messageContent = messages.map(message => message.content.toLowerCase()).join(' ');

  for (const [category, words] of Object.entries(keywords)) {
    words.forEach(word => {
      if (messageContent.includes(word)) {
        extractedKeywords.push(category);
      }
    });
  }

  return extractedKeywords;
}

module.exports = {
  keywords,
  extractKeywords
};
```
### Speech Detection Settings

The `MicrophoneContextProvider` script includes optimized settings for speech detection to enhance performance in various environments:

- **Client-side Execution**: Ensures proper client-side execution with the `"use client"` directive placed at the top of the file, enabling full functionality on the client side.

- **Sensitivity and Thresholds**: Configures a `DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY` value of `0.2` to adjust the gain for loud environments and a `VAD_THRESHOLD` of `0.025` to accurately detect voice activity while minimizing false positives from background noise.

- **Noise Gate**: Includes a `NOISE_GATE_THRESHOLD` variable (currently commented out) for potential use. This variable can be activated to add an additional layer of filtering for non-speech sounds, further improving the clarity of detected speech.

- **Audio Processing**: Utilizes audio processing nodes such as gain and biquad filters. The gain node adjusts microphone sensitivity, while the biquad filter is set to a low-pass configuration with a frequency of 1000 Hz to target the typical range of human speech. These nodes work together to enhance speech detection and suppress unwanted noise.

#### Configuration

File: `./app/context/microphone.tsx`

```javascript
const DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY = 0.5; // Default sensitivity value to capture most sounds effectively
// Example values for different use cases:
// const DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY = 0.6; // Higher sensitivity for quieter environments
// const DEFAULT_SENSITIVITY = 0.3; // Lower sensitivity for louder environments

const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.01; // Moderate threshold for detecting speech
// Example values for different use cases:
// const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.005; // Lower threshold to capture softer speech
// const VAD_THRESHOLD = 0.015; // Higher threshold to filter out more background noise

const NOISE_GATE_THRESHOLD = 0.001; // Noise gate threshold to filter out non-speech sounds
// Example values for different use cases:
// const NOISE_GATE_THRESHOLD = 0.05; // Lower threshold for less strict noise filtering
// const NOISE_GATE_THRESHOLD = 0.2; // Higher threshold for more strict noise filtering
```

## Updating API Endpoints and Integrating Data Sources

The primary API endpoint logic is located in the `route.ts` file at `/agentic-voice/app/api/brain/route.ts`. Hereâ€™s an overview of how to modify it:

1. **Filtering Keywords:** Ensure only relevant keywords are processed.
2. **API Integration:** Customize the API calls to integrate different data sources.
3. **Response Handling:** Adjust the way responses are generated based on the retrieved data.

          return { results: [] };
        }
      })
    );

    const ids = searchResults.flatMap(result => result.results?.map((res: any) => res.id) || []);
    console.log("Search results IDs:", ids);

    // Fallback message if no IDs are found
    if (ids.length === 0) {
      const fallbackMessage = "No relevant content found for the keywords provided.";
      console.log(fallbackMessage);
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4o",
        stream: true,

          "X-LLM-Response": `${Date.now()}`,
        },
      });
    }

    // Get the content based on search results
    const exaApiResponse = await getContentsExaAPI(ids.slice(0, 5), process.env.EXASEARCH_API_KEY!); // Limit to 5 contents
    console.log("Exa API response:", exaApiResponse);

    const retrievedData = exaApiResponse.results.map((result: any) => ({
      id: result.id,
      url: result.url,
      title: result.title,
      author: result.author,
      text: result.text.slice(0, 500), // Limit text to 500 characters
    }));

    // Use the retrieved data to generate contextually relevant responses
    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "gpt-4o",
      stream: true,
      messages: [
        ...messages,
        {
          role: "system",
          content: `Here is an overview of the retrieved data: ${JSON.stringify(retrievedData)}`
        }
      ],
    });
    console.log("OpenAI response created");

    const stream = OpenAIStream(response);
    console.log("OpenAI response stream created");

    return new StreamingTextResponse(stream, {
      headers: {
        "X-LLM-Start": `${start}`,
        "X-LLM-Response": `${Date.now()}`,
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating response with RAG structure", error);
